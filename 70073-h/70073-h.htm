  <h2 class='c011'>I</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c012'>THE clangour of bells grew insistent.
In uncontrollable hilarity pealed S.
Mary, contrasting clearly with the
subdued carillon of S. Mark. From all sides,
seldom in unison, resounded bells. S. Elizabeth
and S. Sebastian, in Flower Street,
seemed in loud dispute, while S. Ann “on the
Hill,” all hollow, cracked, consumptive, fretful,
did nothing but complain. Near by S.
Nicaise, half-paralysed, and impotent, feebly
shook. Then, triumphant, in a hurricane of
sound, S. Irene hushed them all.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Sunday again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Up and up, and still up, the winding ways of
the city the straggling townsfolk toiled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now and again a pilgrim perhaps would
pause in the narrow lane behind the Deanery
to rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Opening a black lacquer fan and setting the
window of her bedroom wide, Miss Sarah
Sinquier peered out.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The lane, very frequently, would prove
interesting of an afternoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Across it, the Cathedral rose up before her
with wizardry against the evening sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier raised her eyes towards the
twin grey spires, threw up her arms, and
yawned.</p>

<p class='c013'>From a pinnacle a devil with limbs entwined
about some struggling crowned-coiffed prey,
grimaced.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>For I yearn for those kisses you gave me once</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>On the steps by Bakerloo!</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Miss Sinquier crooned caressingly, craning
further out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the little old lime trees by the
Cathedral door lounged Lady Caroline Dempsey’s
Catholic footman.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier considered him.</p>

<p class='c013'>In her mind’s eye she saw the impression
her own conversion would make in the parochial
world.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Canon Sinquier’s only daughter has gone
over to Rome....” Or, “Canon Sinquier’s
daughter has taken the veil.” Or, “Miss
Sinquier, having suffered untold persecution at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the hands of her family, has been received into
the Convent of the Holy Dove.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her eyes strayed leisurely from the powdered
head and weeping shoulder-knots of
Lady Caroline Dempsey’s Catholic footman.
The lack of movement was oppressive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why was not Miss Worrall in her customary
collapse being borne senseless to her Gate
in the Sacristan’s arms? And why to-night
were they not chaunting the Psalms?</p>

<p class='c013'>Darting out her tongue, Miss Sinquier withdrew
her head and resumed her book.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pouf!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She shook her fan.</p>

<p class='c013'>The room would soon be dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the grey-toned walls, scriptural, a
<i>Sasso Sassi</i> frowned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In all these fruitful years,” she read, “the
only instance he is recorded to have smiled
was at a great rat running in and out among
some statues.... <i>He</i> was the Ideal Hamlet.
Morose of countenance, and cynical by nature,
his outbursts, at times, would completely
freeze the company.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier passed her finger-tips lightly
across her hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Somehow it makes no difference,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>murmured, turning towards a glass. To feign
Ophelia—no matter what!</p>

<p class='c013'>She pulled about her a lace Manilla shawl.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was as though it were Andalusia whenever
she wrapped it on.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Dona Rosarda!</i>”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Fernan Perez? What do you want?</i>”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Ravishing Rosarda, I need you.</i>”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>I am the wife of Don José Cuchillo—the
Moor.</i>”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Dona Rosarda Castilda Cuchillo, I love
you.</i>”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Sh——! My husband will be back directly.</i>”</p>

<p class='c015'>Stretched at ease before a pier-glass, Miss
Sinquier grew enthralled.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour sped by.</p>

<p class='c013'>The room was almost dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>Don José would wish his revenge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Rosarda.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Fernando?</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Ah-h!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier got up.</p>

<p class='c013'>She must compose herself for dinner—wash
off the blood.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Fernan!</p>

<p class='c013'>She glanced about her, a trifle Spanish still.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>From a clothes-peg something hanging
seemed to implore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To see me? Why, bless you. Yes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>With an impetuous, pretty gesture she flung
it upon a couch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do I like America?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I adore it.... You see ... I’ve lost
my heart here—! Tell them so—oh!
especially to the men.... Whereabouts was
I born? In Westmorland; yes. <i>In England,
Sir!</i> Inquisitive? Why not at all: I was
born in the sleepy peaceful town of Applethorp
(three p’s), in the inmost heart—right in the
very middle,” Miss Sinquier murmured,
tucking a few field flowers under her chin, “of
the <i>Close.</i>”</p>

make out where you sat at Vespers,
child, to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the old-world Deanery drawing room,
coffee and liqueurs—a Sunday indulgence—had
been brought in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier set down her cup.</p>

<p class='c013'>Behind her, through the open windows, a
riot of light leaves and creepers was swaying
restively to and fro.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I imagine the <i>Font</i> hid me,” she answered
with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>Canon Sinquier considered with an absent
air an abundant-looking moon, then turned
towards his wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To-morrow, Mary,” he said, “there’s
poor Mrs. Cushman again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At her cylinder-desk, between two flickering
candles, Mrs. Sinquier, while her coffee grew
cold, was opening her heart to a friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do, Mike, keep still,” she begged.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Still?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t fidget. Don’t talk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Or dare to breathe,” her daughter added,
taking up a Sunday journal and approaching
nearer the light.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘At the Olive Theatre,’” she read, “‘Mrs.
Starcross will produce a new comedy, in the
coming autumn, which promises to be of the
highest interest.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her eyes kindled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh God!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘At the Kehama, Yvonde Yalta will be
seen shortly in a Japanese piece, with singing
mandarins, geishas, and old samurai—’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Mr. and Mrs. Mary are said to be contemplating
Management again.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heavens above!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘For the revival of <i>She Stoops to——</i>’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Crescendo, across the mist-clad Close broke
a sorrowful, sated voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can fasten the window, Sarah,”
Canon Sinquier said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Miss Biggs!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who could have taught her? How?”
the Canon wondered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sinquier laid down her pen.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“I dread her intimate dinner!” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it to be intimate?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Isn’t she always? ‘Come round and see
me soon, Miss Sarah, <i>there’s</i> a dear, and let’s be
intimate!’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Really, Sally!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sally can take off anyone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s vulgar, dear, to mimic.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Vulgar?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It isn’t nice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Many people do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only mountebanks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d bear a good deal to be on the stage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Canon Sinquier closed his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Recite, dear, something; soothe me,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, if you wish it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soothe me, Sally!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something to obliterate the sermon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier looked down at her feet. She
had on black babouches all over little pearls
with filigree butterflies that trembled above
her toes.</p>

Mrs. Sinquier went on, “at the Palace fête last

<p class='c013'>“Between now and <i>that</i>,” Miss Sinquier reflected,
shortly afterwards, on her way upstairs,
“I shall almost certainly be in town.”</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c012'>IN the Gazebo at the extremity of the
garden, by the new parterre, Miss Sinquier,
in a morning wrapper, was waiting
for the post.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the trellis chinks, semicircular,
showed the Close, with its plentiful, seasoned
timber and sedate, tall houses, a stimulating
sequence, architecturally, of whitewash, stone
and brick.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier stirred impatiently.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wretch—! to deliver at the Palace before
the Deanery, when the Deanery was as near!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shower down over there, Oh Lord, ten
thousand fearsome bills,” extemporaneously
she prayed, “and spare them not at all;
Amen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hierarchic hands shot upwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dull skies.</p>

<p class='c013'>She waited.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the Palace gates, at length, the
fellow lurched, sorting as he came.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dolt!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Her eyes devoured his bag.</p>

<p class='c013'>Coiled round and round like some sleek
snake her future slumbered in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Husband; lovers ... little lives, perhaps—yet
to be ... besides voyages, bouquets,
diamonds, chocolates, duels, casinos...!</p>

<p class='c013'>She shivered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anything for me, Hodge, to-day,” she
inquired, “by chance?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A fine morning, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unusually.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It had come....</p>

<p class='c013'>That large mauve envelope, with the wild
handwriting, and the haunting scent, was from
<i>her.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>As she whisked away her heart throbbed fast.
Through the light spring foliage she could see
her father, with folded hands, pacing meditatively
to and fro before the front of the
house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Humbug!” she murmured, darting down
a gravel path towards the tradesmen’s door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Regaining her room, she promptly undid the
seal.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<i>Panvale Priory, Shaftesbury Avenue,</i>
“<i>London, W.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Albert Bromley presents her compliments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to Miss S. Sinquier and will be pleased
to offer her her experience and advice on
Thursday morning next at the hour Miss
Sinquier names.</p>

<p class='c017'>“P.S. Mrs. Bromley already feels a parent’s
sympathetic interest in Miss Sinquier. Is she
dark or fair...? Does she shape for Lady
Macbeth or is she a Lady Teazle?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Both!” Miss Sinquier gurgled, turning
a deft somersault before the glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>To keep the appointment, without being
rushed, she would be obliged to set out,
essentially baggageless, to-night—a few requisites
merely, looped together and concealed
beneath her dress, would be the utmost she
could manage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A lump here and a lump there!” she
breathed, “and I can unburden myself in the
train.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She peeped within her purse.</p>

<p class='c013'>... And there was Godmother’s chain that
she would sell!</p>

<p class='c013'>It should bring grist; perhaps close on a
thousand pounds. Misericordia: to be compelled
to part with it!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Opening a levant-covered box, she drew out
a long flat tray.</p>

<p class='c013'>Adorable pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>How clearly now they brought her Godmother
to mind ... a little old body ...
with improbable cherry-cheeks, and excrescent
upper lip, with always the miniatures of her
three deceased husbands clinging about one
arm.... ‘Aren’t they pleasant?’ she would
say proudly every now and then.... What
talks they had had; and sometimes of an
evening through the mauve moonlight they
would strut together.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ah! She had been almost ugly then;
clumsy, gawky, <i>gauche.</i>...</p>

<p class='c013'>Now that she was leaving Applethorp, for
ever perhaps, how dormant impressions revived!</p>

<p class='c013'>The Saunders’ Fifeshire bull, one New
Year’s night, ravaging the Close, driven
frantic by the pealings of the bells. The time
poor Dixon got drowned—at a Flower Show,
a curate’s eyes—a German governess’s walk—a
mould of calves-foot-jelly she had let fall in
the Cathedral once, on her way somewhere—</p>

<p class='c013'>She replaced ruefully her pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>What else?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Her artist fingers hovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mere bridesmaid’s rubbish; such frightful
frippery.</p>

<p class='c013'>She turned her thoughts to the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over the bed, an antique Bush-knife of
barbaric shape supposed to have been
<i>Abraham’s</i>, was quite a collector’s piece.</p>

<p class='c013'>It might be offered to some museum perhaps.
The Nation ought to have it....</p>

<p class='c013'>She sighed shortly.</p>

<p class='c013'>And downstairs in the butler’s room there
were possessions of hers, besides. What of
those Apostle spoons, and the two-pronged
forks, and the chased tureen?</p>

<p class='c013'>Leonard frequently had said it took the
best part of a day to polish her plate alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>And to go away and leave it all!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh God, help me, Dear,” she prayed.
“This little once, Oh Lord! For Thou
knowest my rights....”</p>

<p class='c013'>She waited.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why did not an angel with a basket of
silver appear?</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, well....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Gripper, no doubt, would suspect something
odd if she asked for her things “to play with”
for an hour....</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>A more satisfactory scheme would be
to swoop into the pantry, on her way to
the station, and to take them away for
herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>She had only to say: “Make haste with
them crevets,” for Gripper to go off in a huff,
and Leonard, should he be there, would be
almost sure to follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Men were so touchy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hush.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her mother’s voice came drifting from
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She listened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have the chintz curtains in the white
room folded,” she could hear her say, “and
remember what I said about the carpet....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Dear soul!</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier sniffed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Was it a tear.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dear soul! Dear souls...!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind,” she murmured, “they shall
have <i>sofas</i> in their box on the night of my
début....”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>She recalled Fräulein’s erudite query still:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pray, why did they not take off all like the

<p class='c013'>And the young man’s significant reasons and
elaborate suppositions, and Fräulein’s creamy
tone as she said she <i>quite</i> understood.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier turned a key.</p>

<p class='c013'>S-s-s-st!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Butter fingers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a moment she must run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Terrible to forgo her great tureen....</p>

<p class='c013'>She poked it. What magnitude to be sure!</p>

<p class='c013'>Impossible to tow it along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the circumstances, why not take
something less cumbersome instead?</p>

<p class='c013'>There were the Caroline sauce-boats, or the
best Anne teapot, hardly, if ever, in use.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her ideas raced on.</p>

<p class='c013'>And who could resist those gorgeous grapes,
for the train?</p>

<p class='c013'>Together with their dish....</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tudor, ‘Harry’!” she breathed.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the corridor came a hum of voices.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flinging her wrap about her, Miss Sinquier
slipped quietly out by way of a small room,
where the Canon preserved his lawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Outside, the moon was already up—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>full moon, high and white, a wisp of cloud
stretched across it like a blindfold face.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh Fame, dear!</p>

<p class='c013'>She put up her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>Across the garden the Cathedral loomed out
of a mist as white as milk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The damp,” she reasoned, “alone, would
justify her flight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She shivered.</p>

<p class='c013'>How sombre it looked in the lane.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were roughs there frequently, too.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Villains....”</p>

<p class='c013'>She felt fearfully her pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all, the initial step in any career was
usually reckoned the worst.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some day, at the King’s, or the Canary, or
the Olive, in the warmth of a stage dressing-room,
she would be amused, perhaps, and say:</p>

sky was visibly brightening as Miss
Sinquier, tired, and a little uncertain,
passed through the main exit of Euston
terminus.</p>

<p class='c013'>She wavered a moment upon the curb.</p>

<p class='c013'>On a hoarding, as if to welcome her, a
dramatic poster of Fan Fisher unexpectedly
warmed her heart; it was almost like being
met....</p>

<p class='c013'>There stood Fan, at concert pitch, as Masha
Olgaruski in <i>The Spy.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier tingled.</p>

<p class='c013'>A thing like that was enough to give one
wings for a week.</p>

<p class='c013'>She set off briskly, already largely braced.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before meeting Mrs. Bromley on the morrow
much would have to be done.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was the difficulty of lodgement to
consider.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever she had been in the metropolis
before she had stayed at <i>Millars</i> in Eric Street,
overlooking Percy Place; because Mr. Millar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>had formerly been employed at the Deanery,
and had, moreover, married their cook....</p>

<p class='c013'>But before going anywhere she must acquire
a trunk.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even Church dignitaries had been known
to be refused accommodation on arriving at
a strange hotel with nothing but themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>She threw a glance upwards towards a clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early yet!</p>

<p class='c013'>All the wonderful day stretched before her,
and in the evening she would take a ticket
perhaps for some light vaudeville or new revue.</p>

<p class='c013'>She studied the pleasure announcements on
the motor-buses as they swayed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stella Starcross—The Lady from the Sea—This
evening, Betty Buttermilk and Co.—Rose
Tournesol—Mr. and Mrs. Mary’s Season:

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier blinked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile the family teapot was becoming
a bore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Until the shops should open up it might be
well to take a taxi and rest in the Park for an
hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather was clearing fast; the day
showed signs of heat.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>She hailed a passing cab.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hyde Park,” she murmured, climbing
slowly in.</p>

<p class='c013'>She thrilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the floor and over the cushions of the
cab was sprinkled fresh confetti—turquoise,
pink and violet, gold and green.</p>

<p class='c013'>She took up some.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a mascot, she reflected, it would be
equivalent to a cinqfoil of clover, or a tuft of
edelweiss, or a twist of hangman’s rope.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c012'>FROM the big hotel in the vicinity of
the Marble Arch, to the consulting rooms
in Shaftesbury Avenue of Mrs. Albert
Bromley, it appeared, on inquiry, that the
distance might easily be accomplished in less
than forty minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier, nevertheless, decided to
allow herself more.</p>

<p class='c013'>Garmented charmingly in a cornflower-blue
frock with a black gauze turban trimmed with
a forest of tinted leaves, she lingered uplifted
by her appearance before the glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sober turban, no doubt, would suggest
to Mrs. Bromley, Macbeth—the forest-scene,
and the blue, she murmured, “might be
anything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It occurred to her as she left her room that
Mr. Bromley might quite conceivably be
there to assist his wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Odious if he is,” she decided, passing
gaily out into the street.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>It was just the morning for a walk. A pale
silvery light spread over Oxford Street, while
above the shop fronts, the sun flashed down
upon a sea of brass-tipped masts, from whence
trade flags trembled in a vagrant breeze.
Rejoicing in her independence, and in the
exhilarating brightness of the day, Miss
Sinquier sailed along. The ordeal of a first
meeting with a distinguished dramatic expert
diminished at every step. She could conjecture
with assurance, almost, upon their ultimate,
mutual understanding. But before expressing
any opinion, Mrs. Bromley, no doubt, would
require to test her voice; perhaps, also, expect
her to dance and declaim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier thrust out her lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not before Albert! Or, at any rate not
yet....” she muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>She wondered what she knew.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was the thing from <i>Rizzio.</i> The
Mistress of the Robes’ lament upon her
vanished youth, on discovering a mirror
unexpectedly, one morning, at Holyrood,
outside Queen Mary’s door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Diamond, Lady Drummond, bearing the
Queen a cap, raps, smiles, listens ... smiles,
raps again, puts out her leg and rustles ...
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>giggles, ventures to drop a ring, effusive facial
play and sundry tentative noises, when
catching sight of her reflection, she starts back
with:</p>

<p class='c013'>“O! obnoxious old age. O! hideous
horror. O! youthful years all gone. O!
childhood spent. Decrepitude at hand....
Infirmities drawing near....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Interrupted by Mary’s hearty laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Miss Sinquier decided, crossing into
Regent Street, “should Mrs. Bromley bid me
declaim, I’ll do Diamond.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her eyes brightened.</p>

<p class='c013'>How prettily the street swerved.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule, great thoroughfares were free
from tricks.</p>

<p class='c013'>She sauntered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A picture-palace.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And just beyond were the playhouses
themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Theatreland!</p>

<p class='c013'>Shaftesbury Avenue with its slightly foreign
aspect stretched before her.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a springing foot she turned up it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh, those fragile glass façades with the
players’ names suspended!</p>

<p class='c013'>There was the new Merrymount Theatre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>with its roguish Amorini supporting torches
and smiling down over gay flower-boxes on to
the passers-by.</p>

<p class='c013'>And beyond, where the burgeoning trees
began must be Panvale Priory itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier surveyed it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It looked to be public offices....</p>

<p class='c013'>On the mat, dressed in a violet riband, with
its paw in the air, lay a great sly, black,
joyous cat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Toms!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She scratched it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Could it be Mrs. Bromley’s?</p>

<p class='c013'>In the threshold, here and there, were small
brass plates, that brought to mind somehow
memorial tablets to departed virtue at
home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier studied the inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ah, there showed hers!</p>

<p class='c013'>“M-m-m!” she murmured, commencing to
climb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the skylight a caged bird was singing
shrilly.</p>

<p class='c013'>As much to listen, as to brush something to
her cheeks, Miss Sinquier paused.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a microscopic mirror could be relied upon
she had seldom looked so well.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Scrambling up the remaining stairs with
alacrity, she knocked.</p>

<p class='c013'>A maid with her head wreathed in curl-papers
answered the door, surveying the
visitor first through a muslin blind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier pulled out a card.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is Mrs. Bromley in?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>The woman gazed at her feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Bromley’s gone!” she replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose she won’t be long?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s in Elysium.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At the——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Mrs. Bromley’s dead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Bromley <i>dead.</i>..?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Mrs. Bromley died last night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier staggered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps you’d care to come in and sit
down?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier hesitated.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, not if ... <i>is</i>? Oh!” she stammered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She was taken quite of a sudden.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One can hardly yet believe it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll be a loss to her world, alas, poor
Betty Bromley will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier swallowed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“I should like to attend the funeral,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s no funeral.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No funeral?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No invitations, that is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier turned away.</p>

<p class='c013'>The very ground under her seemed to slide....</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Bromley dead!</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, the ink of her friendly note seemed
scarcely dry!</p>

<p class='c013'>On the pavement once more she halted to
collect herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Who was there left at all?</p>

<p class='c013'>At Croydon, there was a conservatoire, of
course—</p>

<p class='c013'>She felt a little guilty at the rapidity of the
idea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Woolgathering, she breasted the traffic in
St. Martin’s Lane.</p>

<p class='c013'>She would turn the situation over presently
more easily in the Park.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instinctively, she stopped to examine a
portrait of Yvonde Yalta in the open vestibule
of the Dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>She devoured it: Really...? Really?
She resembled more some Girton guy than a
great coquette.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>All down the street indeed, at the theatre
doors, were studies of artists, scenes from
current plays.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time she found herself back in
Piccadilly Circus again Miss Sinquier was
nearly fainting from inanition.</p>

<p class='c013'>She peered around.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Regent Street, she reflected, almost
certainly, there must be some nice tea-shop,
some cool creamery....</p>

<p class='c013'>How did this do?</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Café Royal!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier fluttered in.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the door, the tables all proved to be taken.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such a noise!</p>

<p class='c013'>Everyone seemed to be chattering, smoking,
lunching, casting dice, or playing dominoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>She advanced slowly through a veil of opal
mist, feeling her way from side to side with her
parasol.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was like penetrating deeper and deeper
into a bath.</p>

<p class='c013'>She put out her hand in a swimming,
groping gesture, twirling as she did so,
accidentally, an old gentleman’s moustache.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thank heaven! There, by that pillar,
was a vacant place.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>She sank down on to the edge of a crowded
couch, as in a dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tall mirrors that graced the walls told
her she was tired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bring me some China tea,” she murmured
to a passing waiter, “and a bun with currants
in it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She leaned back.</p>

<p class='c013'>The realization of her absolute loneliness
overcame her suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Mrs. Bromley, poor kindly little soul!</p>

<p class='c013'>The tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would have been a relief to have blotted
her face against some neighbouring blouse or
waistcoat and to have had a hearty cry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me, may I ask you to be so
good——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just before her on the table was a stand for
matches.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a mournful glance she slid the apparatus
from her in the direction of an adolescent of
a sympathetic, somewhat sentimental, appearance,
who, despite emphatic whiskers, had the
air of a wildly pretty girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>To have cherished such an one as a brother!
Miss Sinquier reflected, as the waiter brought
her tea.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>While consuming it, she studied the young
man’s chiselled profile from the corners of her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Supporting his chin upon the crook of a cane,
he was listening, as if enthralled, to a large
florid man, who, the centre of a small, rapt
group, was relating in a high-pitched, musical
voice, how “Poor dear Chaliapin one day had
asked for Kvass and was given Bass. And
that reminds me,” the speaker said, giving the
table an impressive thump, “of the time when
Anna Held—let go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier glowed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here were stage folk, artists, singers ...
that white, thin girl in the shaggy hat opposite
was without doubt a temperament akin.</p>

<p class='c013'>She felt drawn to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you tell me how I should go to
Croydon?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>The words came slowly, sadly almost....</p>

<p class='c013'>“To Croydon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can’t go to Croydon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The young man of the whiskers looked
amused.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When we all go to Spain to visit Velasquez——”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Goya——!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Velasquez!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goya! Goya! Goya!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“... We’ll set you on your way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goose!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One goes to Croydon best by Underground,”
the pale-looking girl remarked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier winced.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Underground!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her lip quivered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there anything the matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Folding her arms upon the table she
sank despairingly forward and burst into
tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Mrs. Bromley!” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the name of <i>Fortune.</i>...” The pale
young woman wondered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What has Serephine said? What has Mrs.
Sixsmith done?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monstrous tease!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The stout man wagged a finger.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wicked!” he commented.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady addressed kindled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I merely advised her to go Underground.
By tube.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh God,” Miss Sinquier shook.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“It’s hysteria. Poor thing, you can see
she’s overwrought.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give her a <i>fine;</i> <i>un bon petit cognac.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Waiter!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Garçon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind, Precious,” the fat man
crooned. “You shall ride in a comfy taxi-cab
with me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; indeed she shan’t,” Mrs. Sixsmith
snapped. “You may rely on me, Ernest, for
that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Rejecting the proffered spirits with a
gesture, Miss Sinquier controlled her grief.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s not <i>often</i> I’m so silly,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There, there!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse this exhibition....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith squeezed her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My poor child,” she said, “I fear you’ve
had a shock.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s over now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m so glad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve been very good.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not at all. You interest me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why? Why?... I’m sure I can’t say
<i>why</i>! But directly I saw you....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s simply wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“You marched in here for all the world like
some great coquette.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You mean the Father Christmas at the
door?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me what had happened.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few words Miss Sinquier recounted her
tale.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear,” Mrs. Sixsmith said, “I shouldn’t
think of it again. I expect this Mrs. Bromley
was nothing but an old procuress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A procuress?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A stage procuress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How dreadful it sounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you no artistic connections in town
<i>at all</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not really....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then here, close at hand ... sitting
with you and me,” she informally presented,
“Is Mr. Ernest Stubbs, whose wild
wanderings in the Gog-magog hills in sight of
Cambridge, orchestrally described, recently
thrilled us all. Next to him—tuning his locks
and twisting his cane—you’ll notice Mr.
Harold Weathercock, an exponent of calf-love
parts at the Dream. And, beyond, blackening
her nose with a cigarette, sprawls the most
resigned of women—Miss Whipsina Peters, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>daughter of the famous flagelist—and a
coryphée herself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Peters nodded listlessly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Toodle-doo,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As a coryphée, I suppose her diamonds
are a sight?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A sight!” Mrs. Sixsmith closed her
eyes. “They’re all laid up in lavender, I
fear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In lavender?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pledged.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, poor soul.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just now you spoke of a necklace of your
own ... a pearl rope, or something, that
you wish to sell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unhappily I’m obliged.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a notion I might be of service in the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Through an old banker-friend of mine—Sir
Oliver Dawtry. Down Hatton Garden
way and throughout the City he has enormous
interests. And I should say <i>he</i> could place
your pearls—if anyone could!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think he’d be bothered?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That I’ll undertake.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Does he live in town?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“In a sense: he has a large house in the
Poultry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course I should be willing to show him
my pearls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Oliver is offering me a little dinner to-night.
And I should be happy for you to
join us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh?... I think I scarcely dare!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rubbish. One must be bolder than that
if one means to get on!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me where you dine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At Angrezini’s. It’s a little restaurant
... with a nigger band. And you sing
between the courses.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will Mr. Sixsmith be there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear, Mr. Sixsmith and I don’t live
together any more.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier’s eyes grew dim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Used he to act?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Act!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I seem to have heard of him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith looked away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you coming, Serephine?” her neighbour
asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you all off?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The florid man nodded impressively.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes ... we’re going now....” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are Whipsina’s plans?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Peters leaned closely forward over
several pairs of knees.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall stay where I am,” she murmured,
“and perhaps take a nap. There’s sure to be
a tremendous exodus directly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier rose. “I’ve some shopping,”
she said, “to do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Until this evening, then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At what o’clock?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At 8.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On arrival, am I to ask for you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better ask for Sir Oliver—one never knows....
And I might perhaps happen to be late.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you won’t be? You mustn’t....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will explain whatever’s needful by
telephone to Sir Oliver now. And during
dinner,” Mrs. Sixsmith bubbled, “while the
old gentleman picks a quail, we will see what
we can do!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How can I express my thanks...?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The question of commission,” Mrs. Sixsmith
murmured with a slight smile, “we will
discuss more fully later on.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_7 c012'>SUBJECTIVE. On a rack in the loom.
Powerless oneself to grasp the design.
Operated on by others. At the mercy

and because of friction. Stung into sentiency
gradually, bit by bit—a toe at a time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For Thou knowest well my safety is in

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Through the shadowy palings it slipped
away, abundantly dotted with lovers. Some
were plighting themselves on little chairs,
others preferred the green ground: and
beyond them, behind the whispering trees,
the sky gleamed pale and luminous as church
glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>Glory to have a lover too, she reflected, and
to stroll leisurely-united through the evening
streets, between an avenue of sparkling
lamps....</p>

<p class='c013'>Her thoughts turned back to the young
man in the Café Royal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of all the bonny loves!” she breathed,
as her taxi stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Angrezini!”</p>

<p class='c013'>A sturdy negro helped her out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For Thou knowest very well——” her lips
moved faintly.</p>

<p class='c013'>The swinging doors whirled her in.</p>

<p class='c013'>She found herself directly in a small
bemirrored room with a hatch on one side of
it, in which an old woman in a voluminous
cap was serenely knitting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Behind her dangled furs and wraps that
scintillated or made pools of heavy shade as
they caught or missed the light.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Relinquishing her own strip of tulle, Miss
Sinquier turned about her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through a glass door she could make out
Mrs. Sixsmith herself, seated in a cosy red-walled
sitting-room beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was looking staid as a porcelain goddess
in a garment of trailing white with a minute
griffin-eared dog peeping out its sheeny paws
and head wakefully from beneath her train.</p>

<p class='c013'>At sight of her guest Mrs. Sixsmith smiled
and rose.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Oliver hasn’t yet come!” she said,
imprinting on Miss Sinquier’s youthful cheek
a salute of <i>hospitality.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“He hasn’t? And I made sure I should be
last.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith consulted the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the Bank to the Poultry, and from
the Poultry on...; just consider,” she calculated,
subsiding leisurely with Miss Sinquier
upon a spindle-legged settee.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You telephoned?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I told him all your story.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has promised me to do his utmost.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He will?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You should have heard us. This Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Bromley, he pretends.... Oh, well ... one
must not be too harsh on the dead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor little woman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me admire your frock.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You like it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never saw anything so waggish.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, <i>please</i>——!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me where they are!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m looking for your pearls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re in my hair.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Show me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll miss them terribly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Incline!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“More.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’re very nice. But bear in mind
one thing——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith slipped an encircling arm
about Miss Sinquier’s waist.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Always remember,” she said, “to a City
man, twelve hundred sounds less than a
thousand. Just as a year, to you and me,
sounds more than eighteen months!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll not forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Here is Sir Oliver now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the swing doors an elderly man
with a ruddy, rather apoplectic face, and
close-set opaque eyes, precipitantly advanced.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ladies!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Ladies’ indeed, Sir Oliver.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As if——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monster.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me, Serephine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your pardon rests with Miss Sinquier,”
Mrs. Sixsmith said with melodious inflections
as she showed the way towards the restaurant.
“Address your petitions to her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the crescent-shaped, cedar-walled, cedar-beamed
room, a table at a confidential angle
had been reserved.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a big gathering here to-night,”
Sir Oliver observed, glancing round him, a
“board-room” mask clinging to him still.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier looked intellectual.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I find it hot!” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I find London really very hot.... It’s
after the north, I suppose. In the north it’s
always much cooler.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you from the north?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, indeed she is,” Mrs. Sixsmith chimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>in. “And so am <i>I</i>,” she said. “Two north-country
girls!” she added gaily.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Oliver spread sentimentally his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The swans at Blenheim; the peacocks at
Warwick!” he sighed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean, Sir Oliver?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Intimate souvenirs....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should say so.... Swans and peacocks!
I wonder you’re prepared to admit it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Admit it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Outside of <i>Confessions</i>, Sir Oliver.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier raised a hurried hand to her
glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, no, no, no, no wine!” she
exclaimed. “Something milky....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fiddlesticks. Our first little dinner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Sir Oliver.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And not, I trust, our last!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I enjoy it so much—going out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith slapped her little dog smartly
upon the eyes with her fan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couch-toi,” she admonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What can fret her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She fancies she sees Paul.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Worthless fellow!” Sir Oliver snapped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was his rib, Sir Oliver.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forget it.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“I can’t forget it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“J-j-j——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only this afternoon I ran right into him—it
was just outside the Café Royal....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scamp.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He looked superb. Oh, so smart; spats,
speckled trousers, the rest all deep indigo.
Rather Russian.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My actor-husband, Paul. There. One has
only to speak his name for Juno to jerk her tail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With whom is he at present?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With Sydney Iphis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We went last night to see Mrs. Starcross,”
Sir Oliver said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s no draw.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I long to see her,” Miss Sinquier breathed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand, my dear young lady, you’ve
an itch for the footlights yourself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier began eating crumbs at
random.</p>

<p class='c013'>“God knows!” she declared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“C’est une âme d’élite, Sir Oliver.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve no experience at all?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“None.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Oliver refused a dish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We old ones ...” he lamented. “Once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>upon a time, I was in closer touch with the
stage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Even so, Sir Oliver, you still retain your
footing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Footing, f-f-f——; among the whole
demned lot, who persists still but, perhaps, the
Marys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take the Marys. A word to them; just
think what a boon!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing so easy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier clasped her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One has heard of them often, of course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. and Mrs. Mary have won repute
throughout the realm,” Mrs. Sixsmith impressively
said, wondering (as middlewoman)
what commission she should ask.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Mary, I dare say, is no longer what
she was!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Mary, <i>aujourd’hui</i>, is a trifle, perhaps,
full-blown, but she’s most magnetic
still. And a warmer, quicker heart never
beat in any breast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In her heyday, Sir Oliver—but you
wouldn’t have seen her, of course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The baronet’s eyes grew extinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In my younger days,” he said, “she was
comeliness itself ... full of fun. I well recall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>her as the ‘wife’ in <i>Macbeth;</i> I assure you
she was positively roguish.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Being fairly on now in years,” Miss
Sinquier reflected, “she naturally wouldn’t
fill very juvenile parts—which would be a
blessing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She too often does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She used to make Paul ill——” Mrs. Sixsmith
began, but stopped discreetly. “Oh,
listen,” she murmured, glancing up towards
the nigger band and insouciantly commencing
to hum.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it...?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the <i>Belle of Benares</i>—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Apropos of pearls ...” Sir Oliver addressed

<p class='c013'>“They’re on her head, Sir Oliver!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Oliver started as a plate was passed
unexpectedly over him from behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before approaching some City firm, it’s
possible Lady Dawtry might welcome an
opportunity of acquiring this poor child’s
jewels for herself,” Mrs. Sixsmith said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Dawtry!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Dawtry seldom wears ornaments;
often I wish she would.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder you don’t <i>insist.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Oliver fetched a sigh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Many’s the time,” he said, “I’ve asked her
to be a little more spectacular—but she won’t.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How women do vary!” Mrs. Sixsmith
covertly smiled.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“To be sure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My poor old friend...?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Oliver turned away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I notice Miss Peters here to-night,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whipsina?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With two young men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Un trio n’excite pas de soupçons</i>, they say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They do....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you a programme for presently,
Sir Oliver?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a box at the Kehama.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier looked tragic.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’ll have begun!” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At a variety, the later the better as a rule.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never like to miss <i>any</i> part.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear, you’ll miss very little; besides
it’s too close to linger over dinner long.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Toc, toc; I don’t find it so,” Sir Oliver
demurred.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith plied her fan.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c012'>MARY LODGE, or Maryland, as it
was more familiarly known, stood
quite at the end of Gardingore
Gate, facing the Park.</p>

<p class='c013'>Half-way down the row, on the Knightsbridge
side, you caught a glimpse of it set
well back in its strip of garden with a curtain
of rustling aspen-trees before the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Erected towards the close of the eighteenth
century as a retreat for a fallen minister, it
had, on his demise, become the residence of
a minor member of the reigning Royal House,
from whose executors, it had, in due course,
passed into the hands of the first histrionic
couple in the land.</p>

<p class='c013'>A gravel sweep leading between a pair of
grotesquely attenuated sphinxes conducted,
via a fountain, to the plain, sober façade in
the Grecian style.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moving demurely up this approach some
few minutes prior to the hour telegraphically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>specified by the mistress of the house, Miss
Sinquier, clad in a light summer dress, with a
bow like a great gold butterfly under her chin,
pulled the bell of Mary Lodge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some day others would be standing at her
own front gate, their hearts a-hammer....</p>

<p class='c013'>A trim manservant answered the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is Mrs. Mary...?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please to come this way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier followed him in.</p>

<p class='c013'>The entrance hall bare but for a porphyry
sarcophagus containing visiting cards, and a
few stiff chairs, clung obviously to royal
tradition still.</p>

<p class='c013'>To right and left of the broad stairway two
colossal battle-pictures, by Uccelli, were
narrowly divided by a pedestalled recess in
which a frowning bust of Mrs. Mary as
Medusa was enshrined.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier, following closely, was shown
into a compartment whose windows faced the
Park.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Mary has not yet risen from lunch,”
the man said as he went away. “But she
won’t be many minutes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Selecting herself a chair with a back suited
to the occasion, Miss Sinquier prepared to wait.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>It was an irregular planned, rather lofty
room, connected by a wide arch with other
rooms beyond. From the painted boiseries
hung glowing Eastern carpets, on which
warriors astride fleet-legged fantastic horses
were seen to pursue wild animals, that fled
helter-skelter through transparent thickets
of may. A number of fragile French chairs
formed a broken ring about a Louis XVI bed—all
fretted, massive pillars of twisted, gilded
wood—converted now to be a seat. Persian
and Pesaro pottery conserving “eternal”
grasses, fans of feathers, strange sea-shells, bits
of Blue-John, blocks of malachite, morsels of
coral, images of jade littered the <i>guéridons</i>
and <i>étagères.</i> A portrait of Mrs. Mary, by
<i>Watts</i>, was suspended above the chimney-place,
from whence came the momentous
ticking of a clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old girl’s lair, no doubt!” Miss
Sinquier reflected, lifting her eyes towards a
carved mythological ceiling describing the
Zodiac and the Milky Way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tongue protruding, face upturned, it was
something to mortify her for ever that Mrs.
Mary, entering quietly, should so get her
unawares.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Look on your left.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you’ll see it; in trine of Mars. The
Seventh House. The House of <i>Marriage.</i>
The House of Happiness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! Mrs. Mary!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re fond of astrology?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know very little about the heavenly
bodies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! <i>Don’t</i> be too impatient there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier stared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Mary was large and robust, with commanding
features and an upright carriage.
She had a Redfern gown of “navy” blue stuff
infinitely laced. One white, long hand, curved
and jewelled, clung as if paralysed above her
breast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seating herself majestically, with a glance
of invitation to Miss Sinquier to do the same,
the eminent actress appraised her visitor
slowly with a cold, dry eye.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And so you’re his ‘little mouse’...!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whose?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Oliver’s ‘second Siddons.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, and what is your forte?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My forte, Mrs. Mary?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Comedy? Tragedy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Either. Both come easy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve no bent?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So long as the part is good.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Sarah’! Are you of Jewish stock?—Sarahs
sometimes are!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh dear, no.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me something of the home circle.
Have you brothers, sisters?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Neither.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is your heart free?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quite.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Boards, I believe, are new to you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m five full feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, ‘Abyssinia.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Abyssinia!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I guessed....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was never there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now say ‘Joan.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Joan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re Comedy, my dear. Distinctly!
And now sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier gasped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know with us it’s Repertoire, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In parts such as one would cast Jane
Jacks you should score.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is she giving up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately she’s obliged. She’s just
had another babelet, poor dear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What were her parts?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In <i>Bashful Miss Bardine</i> the governess
was one of them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And in <i>Lara</i>, she was the orphan.
That part should suit you well,” Mrs. Mary
murmured, rising and taking from a cabinet
a bundle of printed sheets.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it rags?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rags?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“May she——; is she allowed Evening
dress?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind about her dress. Let me
hear how you’d deliver her lines,” Mrs. Mary
tartly said, placing in Miss Sinquier’s hands
a brochure of the play.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should like to know my cue.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A twitter of birds is all. You are now in

<p class='c013'>“<i>Oh! Sir Harry!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Proceed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier lodged a complaint.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How can I when I don’t know the

<p class='c013'>“What does it matter—the plot?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Besides, I feel up to something stronger.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Mary caressed the backs of her books.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then take the slave in <i>Arsinoe</i> and

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_65 c012'>“BLACK her great boots! Not I,”
Miss Sinquier said to herself as she
turned her back on Mary Lodge to
wend her way westward across the Park.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was to meet Mrs. Sixsmith at a certain
club on Hay Hill towards dusk to learn
whether any tempting offer had been submitted
Sir Oliver for her pearls.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I chose I suppose I could keep them,”
she murmured incoherently to herself as she
crossed the Row.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was an airless afternoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the small formal trees sheltering
the path she clapped her sunshade to, and
slackened speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rhododendrons, in vivid clumps of new
and subtle colours brushing the ground, were
in their pride. Above, the sky showed purely
blue. She walked on a little way towards
Stanhope Gate when, overcome by the odoriferous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>fragrance of heliotropes and xenias, she
sank serenely to a bench.</p>

<p class='c013'>Far off by the Serpentine a woman was
preaching from a tree to a small audience
gathered beneath. How primeval she looked
as her arms shot out in argument, a discarded
cock’s-feather boa looped to an upper bough
dangling like some dark python in the air
above.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier sat on until the shadows fell.</p>

<p class='c013'>She found her friend on reaching Hay Hill
in the midst of muffins and tea.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I gave you up. I thought you lost,” Mrs.
Sixsmith exclaimed, hitching higher her veil
with fingers super-manicured, covered in oxydized
metal rings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was dozing in the Park.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dreamy kid.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On my back neck I’ve such a freckle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you see Mammy Mary?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing; she offered me Miss Jacks’
leavings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not good enough.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What of Sir Oliver?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hardly know how to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Has he——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith nodded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has had an offer of two thousand
pounds,” she triumphantly said, “for the
pearls alone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two thousand pounds!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Call it three o’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consider what commercial credit that
means....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall play Juliet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Juliet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall have a season.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me take the theatre for you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it a dream?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will find you actors—great artists.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, God!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And, moreover, I have hopes for the
silver, too. Sir Oliver is enchanted with the
spoons—the Barnabas spoon especially. He
said he had never seen a finer. Such a beautiful
little Barny, such a rapture of a little
sinner as it is, in every way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier’s eyes shone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll have that boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What—what boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Harold Weathercock.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“You desire him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To be my Romeo, of course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It depends if the Dream will release him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It must! It shall!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll peep in on him and sound him, if you
like.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll go together.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know where he lives?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In Foreign-Colony Street. He and a
friend of his, Noel Nice, share a studio there.
Not to paint in, alas! It’s to wash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They’ve made a little laundry of it. And
when they’re not acting actually, they wash.
Oh! sometimes when Mr. Nice spits across
his iron and says Pah! it makes one ill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have they any connection?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith bent her eyes to her dress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Sixsmith often sent them things ...
little things,” she said. “His linen was his
pride. You might annex him, perhaps. He’s
played Mercutio before.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is he handsome?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paul? He’s more interesting than handsome.
<i>Unusual</i>, if you know....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What <i>did</i> you do to separate?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“I believe I bit him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He ran at me with the fire-dogs first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose you annoyed him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The cur!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something tells me you’re fond of him
still.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From her reticule Mrs. Sixsmith took a
small note-book and made an entry
therein.</p>

<p class='c013'>“... The divine Shakespeare!” she
sighed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I mean to make a hit with him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My advice to you is, hire a playhouse—the
Cobbler’s End, for example—for three
round months at a reasonable rent, with a
right, should you wish, to sub-let.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s so far off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Define ‘far off.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blackfriars Bridge.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve no doubt by paying a fortune you
could find a more central position if you care
to wait. The Bolivar Theatre, possibly——;
or the Cone.... At the Cone, there’s a joy-plank
from the auditorium to the stage, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>that, should you want to ever, you can come
right out into the stalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want my season at once,” Miss Sinquier
said.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith toyed with her rings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you say,” she asked, “to making
an informal début (before ‘royal’ auspices!) at
the Esmé Fisher ‘Farewell’ coming off next
week?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some of the stage’s brightest ornaments
have consented to appear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d like particulars.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll send a note to the secretary, Miss
Willinghorse, straight away,” Mrs. Sixsmith
murmured, gathering up her constant Juno
beneath her arm, and looking about her for
some ink.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Send it later, from the Café Royal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t go any more to the Café Royal,”
Mrs. Sixsmith said. “I owe money there....
To all the waiters.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait till after we’ve seen the Washingtons.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Washingtons? Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Besides, I’ve a small headache,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Mrs. Sixsmith said, selecting herself a
quill.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What can I do to relieve it?” Miss
Sinquier wondered, taking up a newspaper as
her friend commenced to write.</p>

<p class='c013'>Heading the agony list some initials caught
her eye.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>S——h S——r.</i> Come back. All shall be
forgiven,” she read.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t epistolize while you make those
<i>unearthly</i> noises,” Mrs. Sixsmith complained.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are we going to dine?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is there wonderful to go?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about a grill?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Piccadilly? We’re both about got
up for it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier rolled her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Grill-room at the Piccadilly isn’t
going to cure a headache,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c012'>TO watch Diana rise blurred above a
damp chemise from a fifth-floor laundry
garden in Foreign-Colony Street,
Soho, had brought all Chelsea (and part of
Paris) to study illusive atmospherical effects
from the dizzy drying-ground of those versatile
young men, Harold Weathercock and Noel
Nice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a necropolis at the Resurrection, or
some moody vision of Blake, would it appear
under the evanescent rays of the moon.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nighties, as evening fell, would go off into
proud Praxiteles—torsos of Nymphs or Muses:
pants and ready-mades, at a hint of air would
pirouette and execute a phantom ballet from
Don John.</p>

<p class='c013'>Beyond the clothes lines was a Pagoda, set
up in an extravagant mood, containing a
gilded Buddha—a thorn and a symbol of
unrighteousness to a convent of Ursulines
whose recreation yard was underneath.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Here, at a certain hour when the Mother
Superior was wont to walk round and round
her preserves, a young, bewhiskered man
frequently would come bearing ceremonial
offerings of rice or linen newly washed, and
falling flat before the shrine would roll himself
about and beat the ground as if in mortal
anguish of his sins before her fascinated eye.
Here, too, from time to time, festivities
would take place—sauteries (to a piano-organ),
or convivial <i>petits soupers</i> after the
play.</p>

<p class='c013'>An iron ladder connected the roof with the
work and living-rooms below.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ascending this by the light of the stars,
Mrs. Sixsmith and the <i>New Juliet</i>, gay from a
certain grill, audaciously advanced, their
playful screams rendered inaudible by the
sounds of a tricksome waltz wafted down to
them from the piano-organ above.</p>

<p class='c013'>Items of linen nestling close to a line overhead
showed palely against the night like
roosting doves.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Help.... Oh! she’s falling,” Mrs. Sixsmith
screamed. “Are you there, Mr. Nice?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me your hand,” Miss Sinquier begged.</p>

scrambling to the top.</p>

<p class='c013'>London, beyond the frail filigree cross on
the Ursulines’ bleached wall, blazed with
light. From the Old Boar and Castle over the
way came a perfect flood of it. And all along
the curved river-line from Westminster to St.
Paul’s glittered lamps, lamps, lamps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Folding an arm about her friend’s “wasp”

<p class='c013'>“Come to finish the evening?”</p>

<p class='c013'>A small, thick-set, grizzled man with dark
æsthetic eyes and a pinkish nose, the result
maybe of continuously tinting it for music-hall
purposes, addressed the breathless ladies
in a broad, inquiring voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that <i>you</i>, Mr. Smee?” Mrs. Sixsmith
asked, surprised.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Call me ‘Shawn.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ve only come on business.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Then—do it,” Mrs. Sixsmith serenely said,

<p class='c013'>“They’re not back from the theatre yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Turn for us till they come.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Smee dashed from a crimpled brow a
wisp of drooping hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By your leave, ladies,” he said, “I’ll just
slip across to the Old Boar and Castle and
sample a snack at the bar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t run off, Mr. Smee. You really
mustn’t. On tiles, they say, one usually
meets with <i>cats.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith placed a hand to her hip in
the style of an early John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long is it—say—since we met?”
she inquired. “Not since my wedding, I do
believe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s become of those kiddy bridesmaids
you had?” Mr. Smee warily asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gerty Gale and Joy Patterson?—I’m
sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, how goes the world with <i>you</i>, Mr.
Smee?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So-so. I’ve been away on tour. Mildred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Milson and Co. Oh! my Lord—it was. No
sooner did we get to Buxton—down in
Derbyshire—than Miss Milson fell sick and
had to be left behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was wrong with her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Exposure.... On Bank Holiday some
of the company hired a three-horse char-à-banc
and drove from Buxton over to Castleton
Caves—my hat. What hills!—and from there
we went to take a squint at Chatsworth, where
Miss Milson came over queer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how does Mrs. Smee?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So-so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One never sees her now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There she sits all day, reading Russian
novels. Talk of gloom!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Really?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it is!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well.... I’m fond of thoughtful, theosophical
reading, too, Mr. Smee,” Mrs.
Sixsmith said. “Madame Blavatsky and
Mrs. Annie Besant are both favourites with
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Smee jerked an eloquent thumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who have you brought along?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s a special pal of mine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Married?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Mon Dieu,” Mrs. Sixsmith doubtfully

<p class='c013'>“Now, now...!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t look like that, Mr. Smee—nobody’s

<p class='c013'>Mr. Smee scratched reflectively his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who is it you’re after?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We fancied Mr. Weathercock might
suit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s to create the countess?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Capulet? It’s not determined
yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not canvass the wife?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Has she been in Shakespeare before?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the time she could toddle; in a
<i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, when not quite
two, she was the Bug with gilded wings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pet!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith clasped prayerfully her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And in Mr. Smee,” she said, “I see the
makings of a fine Friar Lawrence!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With a few choice <i>concetti.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Faith!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see the lonely cell, the chianti-flask, the
crucifix....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see Verona ... the torrid sky ... the
town ascending, up, up, up. I hear the
panting nurse. She knocks. Your priest’s
eyes glisten. She enters, blouse-a-gape—a
thorough coster. You raise your cowl....
Chianti? She shakes her head. Benedictine?
No! no! A little Chartreuse, then? Certainly
not! Nothing.... You squeeze her
waist. Her cries ‘go through’ Lady Capulet
and her daughter in the distant city on their
way to mass. Romeo enters. So!” Mrs.
Sixsmith broke off as Mr. Weathercock and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>a curly-headed lad, followed by a swathed
woman and a whey-faced child, showed
themselves upon the stairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith sought Miss Sinquier’s arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen to me, my darling!” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Write.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Write.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because I fear we intrude.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Intrude?” Harold Weathercock exclaimed,
coming up. “I assure you it’s a
treat....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith threw a sidelong, intriguing
glance across her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who’s the cure in plaits?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s Little May Mant—she’s seeing her
sister home.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!... Is that Ita?” Mrs. Sixsmith
murmured, stepping forward to embrace Miss
“Ita Iris” of the Dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier swooped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m having a season,” she, without further
preamble, began. “And I want to
persuade you to join....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Principal?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should like to play for you,” Mr.
Weathercock said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Harold!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Mant addressed him softly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Honey husband....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hook it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me a cigarette.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mary!” her sister called.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quick! ’cos of Ita.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mary Mant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Mant tossed disdainfully an ultra
large and “pasty”-faced head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why must you insult me, Ita?” she
bitterly asked. “You <i>know</i> I’m Miss Iris.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know you’re Miss Mant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I’m not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I’m <i>not.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I tell you, you are!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Liar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“M-A-N-T!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, stow it,” Mr. Smee said. “Put it by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m Réné Iris.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Réné Rats.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith looked detached.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Is that a wash-tub?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s that odd thing floating, like the
ghost of a child unborn?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It belongs to Mrs. Mary.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a rumour—she refuses a fortune
to show herself in Revue.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With her hearse-horse tread....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sh——. Harold worships her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He sees things in her that we don’t,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To some ideas,” Mrs. Sixsmith said, “I
suppose she’s very blooming still....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If it wasn’t for her figure, which is really
a disgrace.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Iris smiled.</p>

<p class='c013'>She had a tired mouth, contrasting vividly
with the artificial freshness of her teeth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I reach my zenith,” she declared,
“it’s Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shall you assist at poor Esmé Fisher’s?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A couple of songs—that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith looked away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Naturally,” Miss Sinquier was saying,
“one can’t expect instantly to be a draw.
More than—perhaps—just a little!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“With a man who understands in the
Box Office....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Someone with a big nose and a strong
will, eh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Nice lifted a rusty iron and wiped it
across his leg.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In my opinion,” he said, “to associate
oneself with a sanctified classic is a huge
mistake. And why start a season on the
tragic tack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose it’s a frost?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose your venture fails. Suppose the
thing’s a drizzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a light comedy of mine that
should suit you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of yours!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Appelled <i>Sweet Maggie Maguire.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me why she was sweet, Mr. Nice,”
Mrs. Sixsmith begged.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why she was sweet? I really don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was she sentimental...?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She was an invalid. A bed-ridden beauty
... and, of course, the hero’s a Doctor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! my word!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Is there anyone at home?” A tired voice
came thrilling up from below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who comes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith started.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It sounds to me like my husband,” she
said, with an involuntary nervous movement
of the hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I forgot,” Mr. Weathercock said. “He
mentioned he might blow in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d take to my heels!” Miss Iris advised.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith stood transfixed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moonlight fell full on her, making her
features look drawn and haggard.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>XI</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_9_0_65 c012'>LIKE wildfire the rumour ran. The
King had knighted—he had knighted—by
what accident?—Mr. Mary, in
lieu of Mr. Fisher, at Mr. Fisher’s own farewell.
In the annals of the stage such an
occurrence was unheard of, unique.</p>

<p class='c013'>The excitement in the green-room was
intense.</p>

<p class='c013'>“M-m! He is not de first to zell is birs-r-rite
for a mess of porridge!” Yvonde Yalta, the
playgoers’ darling, remarked as she poised with
an extravagant play of arms, a black glittering
bandeau on her short flaxen hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A mess of pottage!” someone near her
said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You correct me? Ah, sanx! I am so
grateful, so—<i>so</i> grateful,” the charming creature
murmured as she sailed away.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the auditorium came a suppressed
titter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The curtain had risen some few minutes
since on Mlle. Fanfette and Monsieur Coquelet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>de Chaussepierre of the Théâtre Sans Rancune
in the comedietta, <i>Sydney, or There’s
No Resisting Him.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s extraordinary I’ve never seen a man
knighted,” a show-girl twittered, “and I’ve
seen a good deal....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do they do them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like this,” a sparkling brunette answered,
bestowing a sly pat on the interlocutress with
the back of a brush.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of all the common——!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ladies! Ladies!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who was in front at the time?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was!” Mrs. Sixsmith said, who had just
peeped in to exchange a few words with her
friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You were?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was selling sweets in the vestibule and
saw it all. Really! If I live to be an old
woman I shan’t forget it. Mr. Mary—<i>Sir
Maurice</i>—was in the lobby chatting with
Sylvester Fry of the <i>Dispatch</i>, when the
Royal party arrived. The King instantly
noticed him and sent one of his suite, quite
unpremeditatedly, it seemed, to summon him,
and in a trice ... Oh! ... and I <i>never</i> saw
the Queen look so charming. She has a gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>dress turning to white through the most
exquisite gradations....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith was overcome.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A-wheel,” Miss Sinquier’s dresser disrespectfully
said, “how was the poor man to
tell? Both the blighters—God forgive me—are
equally on their last legs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier shivered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it a good house?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Splendid. Outside they’re flying five
‘full’ boards.... There’s not a single vacant
place. Poor Sydney Iphis gave half a guinea
for a seat in the slips.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you here all alone?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m with Sir Oliver Dawtry,” Mrs. Sixsmith
replied, “except when I’m running
about!... Can I sell anyone anything?”
she inquired, raising sonorously her voice.
“Vanilla! Caramel! Chocolate!... Comfits,”
she warbled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What have you netted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eighteenpence only, so far;—from such
an angel!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Comfits, did you say?” a round-faced,
piquant little woman asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Despite disguise! If it isn’t Arthurine
Smee!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The actress displayed astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nature had thrown up upon her lip and
cheek two big blonde moles that procured to
her physiognomy, somehow or other, an
unusual degree of expression.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My husband has been waiting to hear
from you,” she said, “as agent to this <i>Miss
Sin——</i>, the new star with the naughty name,
and from all I could make out I understand
it would be likely to be a <i>Double Engagement.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is Miss Sinquier,” Mrs. Sixsmith
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier blinked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you done it much?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Often.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For example?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I may say I’ve played Pauline and Portia
and Puck....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mother-to-Juliet I fear’s the best I’ve to
offer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Smee consulted enigmatically the nearest
mole in reach of her tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Were I to play her in ‘good’ preservation,”
she inquired, “I suppose there’d be no
objection?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Why, none!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just a girlish touch....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Smee defies time,” Mrs. Sixsmith
remarked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear, I once was thought to be a very
pretty woman.... All I can do now is to
urge my remains.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier raised a forefinger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices shivering in altercation issued loudly
from a private dressing-room next door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s up?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” the wardrobe-mistress
entering said. “Sir Maurice and Mr.
Fisher are passing sharp words with a couple
of pitchforks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ‘Farm-players’ sent them over from
the Bolivar for their Pig-sty scene—and now
poor Mr. Mary, <i>Sir M’riss</i>, and Mr. Fisher
are fighting it out, and Mrs. Mary, <i>her ladyship</i>,
has joined the struggle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Murder!” called a voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be to God.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith rolled her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Da!” she gasped, as Lady Mary, a trifle
dazed but decked in smiles, came bustling in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Men! Men! Men!” she exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>going off into a hearty laugh. “Rough,
angelic brutes...!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was radiant.</p>

<p class='c013'>She had a gown of shot brocade, a high
lace ruff and a silver girdle of old German
work, that had an ivory missal falling from it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quarrelsome, quarrelling kings,” she stuttered,
drifting towards a toilet-table—the very
one before which Miss Sinquier was making
her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>On all sides from every lip rose up a chorus
of congratulations.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Viva, Lady Mary!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Touched, responsive, with a gesture springing
immediately from the heart, the consummate
Victorian extended impulsive happy
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“God bless you, dears,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three cheers for Lady Mary!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The illustrious woman quashed a tear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Am I white behind?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Allow me, milady,” the wardrobe-mistress
wheezed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I fancy I heard a rip...!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There must have been quite a scrimmage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the orchestra, a melodious throb-thrum-throb
told a “curtain.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Lady Mary—<i>you</i>, Mum,” a call-boy
chirped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Mary showed distress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For goodness sake, my dear,” she addressed
Miss Sinquier, “do leave yourself alone. I
want the glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Miss Sinquier seemed engrossed.</p>

<p class='c013'>At her elbow a slip of a “Joy-baby” was
holding forth with animation to Mrs. Sixsmith
and Mrs. Smee.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one of my dreams,” she was
saying, “and last night again I had another—in
spite of a night-light, too! It began by a
ring formed of crags and boulders enclosing
a troop of deer—oh, such a herd of them—delicate,
distinguished animals with little
pom-pom horns, and some had poodles’ tails.
Sitting behind a rhododendron bush was an
old gentleman on a white horse; he never
moved a muscle. Suddenly I became aware
of a pack of dogs.... And then, before my
very eyes, one of the dogs transformed itself
into a giraffe....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You must have been out to supper.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s true I had. Oh, it was a merry meal.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Who gave it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dore Davis did: to meet her betrothed—Sir
Francis Four.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t ask me. It makes one tired to look
at him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was it a party?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing but literary-people with their Beatrices....
My dear <i>the scum</i>! Half-way through
supper, Dore got her revolver out and began
shooting the glass drops off her chandelier.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should like to see her trousseau,” Mrs.
Sixsmith sighed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It isn’t up to much. Anything good she
sells—on account of bailiffs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pooh! She should treat them all <i>en reine.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Smee looked wise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Always be civil with bailiffs,” she said;
“never ruffle them! If you queen a sheriff’s
officer remember there’s no getting rid of him.
He clings on—like a poor relation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, well,” Mrs. Sixsmith replied, “I
always treat the worms <i>en reine</i>, not,” she
added wittily, “that I ever have....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier twirled herself finally about.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There,” she murmured, “I’m going out
into the wings.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“When’s your call?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After Lady Mary.”</p>

<p class='c013'>For her unofficial first appearance she was
resolved to woo the world with a dance—a
dance all fearless somersaults and quivering
<i>battements;</i> a young Hungarian meanwhile recording
her movements sensitively upon a
violin.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was looking well in an obedient little
ballet skirt that made action a delight. Her
hair, piled high in a towering toupee, had a
white flower in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Down a step and through an arch,” a
pierrette who passed her in the corridor
directed her to the stage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Miss Ita Iris of the Dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier tingled.</p>

<p class='c013'>How often on the cold flags of the great
church at home had she asked the way
before!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Lord,” she prayed now, “let me
conquer. Let me! Amen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was in the wings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Above her, stars sparkled lavishly in a
darkling sky, controlled by a bare-armed
mechanic who was endeavouring, it seemed,
to deliver himself of a moon; craning from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>a ladder at the risk of his life, he pushed it
gently with a big soft hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier turned her eyes to the stage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The round of applause accorded Lady Mary
on her entry was gradually dying away.</p>

<p class='c013'>From her shelter Miss Sinquier could observe
her, in opulent silhouette, perfectly at her
ease.</p>

<p class='c013'>She stood waiting for the last huzzas to
subside with bowed head and folded hands—like
some great sinner—looking reverently up
through her eyelashes at the blue silk hangings
of the Royal box.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees all clatter ceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>Approaching the footlights with a wistful
smile, the favourite woman scanned the stalls.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now most of you here this afternoon,” she
intimately began, “I will venture to say,
never heard of Judy Jacock. I grant you,
certainly, there’s nothing very singular in
that; for her life, which was a strangely frail
one, essentially was obscure. Judy herself
was <i>obscure.</i>... And so that is why I say
you can’t have ever heard of her!... Because
she was totally unknown.... Ah,
poor wee waif! Alas, she’s dead now. Judy’s
among the angels ... and the beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>little elegy which, with your consent, I intend
forthwith to submit, is written around her,
around little Judy, and around her old Father,
her ‘<i>Da</i>’—James, who was a waiter. And
while he was away waiting one day—he used
to wipe the plates on the seat of his breeches!—his
little Judy died. Ah, poor old James.
Poor Sir James. But let the poet,” she broke
off suddenly, confused, “take up the tale
himself, or, rather—to be more specific!—<i>herself.</i>
For the lines that follow, which are
<i>inédit</i>, are from the seductive and charming
pen of Lady Violet Sleepwell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Mary coughed, winked archly an
eye, and began quite carelessly as if it were
Swinburne:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>I never</i> knew <i>James Jacock’s child....</i></div>

      <div class='line in1'><i>The daintiest little fairy that ever a father knew.</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>She was all contentment.</i>...”</div>

beads of scarlet glass, was Miss May Mant.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Sh——! Don’t warn Ita!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why should I?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dodged her. Beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If she thought I was going on the stage,
she’d be simply wild.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you feel the boards?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A little.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They go <i>right</i> through me. Through my

<p class='c020'>The Source Theatre.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_65 c021'>DEAR MOTHER,—I saw your notice
in a newspaper not very long ago,
and this morning I came across it
again in the <i>Dispatch.</i> Really I don’t
know what there can be to “forgive,”
and as to “coming back!”—I have undertaken
the management of this theatre, where
rehearsals of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> have already
begun. This is the little house where Audrey
Anderson made her début, and where Avize
Mendoza made such a hit. You could
imagine nothing cosier or more intimate if
you tried. Father would be charmed (tell
him, for, of course, he sometimes speaks of me
in the long <i>triste</i> evenings as he smokes a
pipe) with the foyer, which has a mural design
in marquetry, showing Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden, sunning themselves by the
side of a well. They say the theatre contains
a well <i>beneath the stage</i>, which is why it’s
known as the Source. I have left, I’m glad to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>say, the hotel, which was getting dreadfully
on my nerves, for a dressing-room here, where
I pass the nights now: an arrangement that
suits me, as I like to be on the spot. A sister
of Ita Iris of the Dream Theatre keeps me
company, so that I’m not a bit solitary. We
understand each other to perfection, and I
find her helpful to me in many ways. She is
such an affectionate child and I do not think
I shall regret it. I’ve decided to have half my
teeth taken out by a man in Knightsbridge—some
trial to me, I fear; but, alas, we’ve
all to carry our cross! I seem to have
nothing but debts. Clothes, <i>as well</i> as
scenery, would ruin anyone.</p>

<p class='c017'>I’m allotting a little box to you and father
for the opening night, unless you would prefer
two stalls?</p>

<p class='c017'>The other afternoon I “offered my services”
and obtained three curtains at a gala
matinée; I wish you could have been at it!</p>
<p class='c022'>Your devoted Daughter.</p>

<p class='c017'>I went to the Oratory on Sunday; it was
nothing but a blaze of candles.</p>

<p class='c017'>Remember me to Leonard and Gripper—also
Kate.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_8_0_65 c012'>AN absence of ventilation made the
room an oven and discouraged sleep.
Through the width of skylight, in
inert recumbence, she could follow wonderingly
the frail pristine tints of dawn. Flushed,
rose-barred, it spread above her with fantastic
drifting clouds masking the morning stars.</p>

<p class='c013'>From a neighbouring church a clock struck
five.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier sighed; she had not closed
her eyes the whole night through.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One needs a blind,” she mused, “and a
pane——.” She looked about her for something
to throw.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Cinquecento</i>, Italian things—a chest, a
crucifix, a huge guitar, a grim, carved catafalque
all purple sticks and violet legs (Juliet’s)
crowded the floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A mess of glass ... and cut my feet ...;”
she murmured, gathering about her a <i>négligé</i>
of oxydized knitted stuff and sauntering out
towards the footlights in quest of air.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Notwithstanding the thermometer, she
could hear Miss May Mant breathing nasally
from behind her door.</p>

<p class='c013'>The stage was almost dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Verona,” set in autumn trees, looked fast
asleep. Here and there a campanile shot up,
in high relief, backed by a scenic hill, or an
umbrella-pine. On a column in the “Market
Place” crouched a brazen lion.</p>

<p class='c013'>An acrobatic impulse took her at the sight
of it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Sono pazza per te</i></div>

      <div class='line in1'><i>Pazza per amore</i>,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>she warbled, leaping lightly over the footlights
into the stalls.</p>
<p class='c013'>The auditorium, steeped in darkness, felt
extinguished, chill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Making a circuit of the boxes, she found her
way up a stairway into the promenade.</p>

<p class='c013'>Busts of players, busts of poets, busts of
peris, interspersed by tall mirrors in gilt-bordered
mouldings, smiled on her good-day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sinking to a low, sprucely-cushioned seat,
she breathed a sigh of content.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rid of the perpetual frictions of the inevitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span><i>personnel</i>, she could possess the theatre,
for a little while, in quietude to herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the long window boxes, tufts of white
daisies inclining to the air brought back to
mind a certain meadow, known as <i>Basings</i>, a
pet haunt with her at home.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the pond end, in a small coppice, doves
cried “Coucoussou-coucoussou” all the day long.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here, soon a year ago, while weaving herself
a garland (she was playing at being
Europa with the Saunders’ Fifeshire bull;
flourishing flowers at it; tempting it with
waving poppies; defying it to bear her away
from the surrounding stagnance), the realization
of her dramatic gift first discovered itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, her thoughts tripped on, <i>he</i>
came: the Rev. George—“just as I was
wondering to whom to apply”—and drew all
Applethorp to S. Ann-on-the-Hill by the
persuasive magnetism of his voice; largely
due—so he said—to “scientific production.”
To the <i>Bromley Breath</i>! He never could
adequately thank Elizabeth, Mrs. Albert
Bromley, for all she had done. No; because
words failed.... Her Institute, for him,
would be always “top-o’-the-tree,” and when
asked, by her, “What tree?” he had answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>with a cryptic look: “She trains them for
the stage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Dear heart! How much he seemed to love
it. He had known by their green-room names
all the leading stars, and could tell on occasion,
little anecdotes of each.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was he who narrated how Mrs. Mary (as
she was then), on the first night of <i>Gulnara,
Queen of the Lattermonians</i>, got caught in
the passenger-lift on the way from her
dressing-room to the stage and was obliged
to allow her understudy to replace her,
which with the utmost <i>éclat</i> she did, while
Mrs. Mary, who could overhear the salvos
from her prison, was driven quite distraught
at a triumph that, but for the
irony of things, would most certainly have
been hers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier sighed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which reminds me,” she murmured,
fixing her eyes upon the storied ceiling, “that
I’ve no one at all, should anything happen
to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She lay back and considered the inchoate
imagery painted in gouache above her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hydropic loves with arms outstretched in
invitation, ladies in hectic hats and billowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>silks, courtiers, lap-dogs, peacocks, etc., all
intermingled in the pleasantest way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As she gazed a great peace fell upon her.
Her eyelids closed.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c013'>“Breakfast!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss May Mant woke her with a start.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I laid it to-day in the stalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Extraordinary child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Crumbs in the boxes, I’ve noticed, encourage
mice.... They must come from
the spring, I think, under the stage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One ought to set a trap!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor creatures ... they enjoy a good
play, I expect, as much as we do,” Miss
Mant murmured, setting down the kettle
she was holding and lowering her cheek graciously
for a kiss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You were asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was I horrid?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You looked too perfectly orchidaceous.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Orchidaceous?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like the little women of Outa-Maro.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier sat up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is there for breakfast?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Do you like porridge?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Réné!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Mant raised a bare shoulder and
crushed it to an ear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Really,” she remarked, “I’m at a loss to
know what to give you, Sally; I sometimes
ask myself what Juliet took....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, potions.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Ita</i> takes tea luke with a lemon; and it
makes her <i>so</i> cross.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Disgusting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“À la Russe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is she still away?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.... She writes from a toy bungalow,
she says, with the sea at the very door and a
small shipwreck lying on the beach.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What of Paris?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m Page to him, you said so!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With her consent.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Ita hates the stage. She’s only <i>on it</i>
of course to make a match ...; she could
have been an Irish countess had she pleased,
only she said it wasn’t smart enough, and it
sounded too Sicilian.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everyone can’t be Roman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“... Oh, she’s such a minx. In her letter
she writes, ‘I don’t doubt you’ll soon grow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>tired of the Sally-Sin Theatre and of dancing
attendance on the Fair Sink.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And her Manting ways just to annoy.
Mant, Mant, Mant! She does it to humiliate.
Whenever the Tirds are in earshot she’s sure to
begin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Tirds?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Llewellyn and Lydia. Lydia Tird has an
understanding with my big brother. Poor
lad! Just before I left home he took the
name of Isadore: Isadore Iris. Oh, when
Ita heard! Bill Mant she said and made
Llewellyn laugh.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now that Mrs. Sixsmith ‘Mants’ me
almost as much as Ita.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why do you dislike her so much?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cadging creature!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Réné?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Limpet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Réné——!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scavenger.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Basta!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know all about her.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“What do you know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I tell you, I’ll have to tell you in
French.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then tell me in French.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Elle fait des cornes à son mari!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What next?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s <i>divorcée</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor soul.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Out at <i>Bois St. Jean</i>—St. John’s Wood—she
has a villa.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier got up.</p>

critics (such high arbiters of the
stage as Sylvester Fry of the <i>Dispatch</i>,
Lupin Petrol of <i>Now</i>, Amethyst Valer of
<i>Fashion</i>, Berinthia of <i>Woodfalls</i> (the terrible,
the embittered Berinthia who was also Angela)),
cards had been sent out from Foreign-Colony
Street, in the comprehensive name of Sir
Oliver Dawtry, the famous banker and financier,
to meet the new lessee of the Source.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of those sultry summer nights of
electricity and tension, when nerves at almost
nothing are apt to explode. Beyond the iron
Calvary on the Ursulines’ great wall, London
flared with lights.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perched upon a parapet in brilliant solitude,
her identity unsuspected by the throng, Miss
Sinquier, swathed in black mousseline and
nursing a sheaf of calla lilies, surveyed the
scene with inexpressive eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And there was the wind bellowing and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>witches wailing: and no Macbeth!” a young
man with a voice like cheap scent was saying
to a sympathetic journalist for whatever it
might be worth....</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier craned her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where were the two “Washingtons”? or
the little Iris girl?</p>

<p class='c013'>By the Buddha shrine, festively decked with
lamps, couples were pirouetting to a nigger
band, while in the vicinity of the buffet, a
masked adept was holding a clairaudience of a
nature only to be guessed at from afar. An
agile negro melody, wild rag-time with passages
of almost Wesleyan hymnishness—reminiscent
of Georgia gospel-missions; the eighteenth
century in the Dutch East Indies—charmed
and soothed the ear.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier jigged her foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>At their cell windows, as if riveted by the
lights and commotion, leaned a few pale nuns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor things.</p>

<p class='c013'>The call of the world could seldom wholly
be quenched!</p>

<p class='c013'>She started as a fan of seabirds’ feathers
skimmed her arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sylvester’s come,” Mrs. Sixsmith in passing
said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aren’t you scared?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scared?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know, he always belittles people.
Sylvester traduces everyone; he even crabs
his daughter; he damns all he sees.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How he got up those narrow stairs is a
mystery to me,” Mrs. Sixsmith smiled.</p>

bustling stars. An elfish horse-shoe moon,
felicitously bright, struck her as auspicious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One should bow to it,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Idolatry!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There! look what nodding does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A blanche bacchante with a top-knot of

<p class='c013'>Miss Valer lowered discreetly her voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And your Romeo?” she queried. “He
must make love angelically?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire enormously his friend.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Nice?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has such perfect sloth. I love his

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier threw a glance towards Mrs.

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to the buffet, child,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I think I’ll join you.”</p>

weekly!” she reflected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You didn’t mention your Old Mechlin
scarf, or your fox-trimmed nightie,” Mrs.
Sixsmith murmured, dexterously evading the
psychic freedoms of the masked adept.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you no shame, <i>Paul</i>?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Paul!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier wondered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mephisto! I know his parlour tricks
... though it would only be just, perhaps,
to say he did foresee our separation some time
before it occurred.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, how extraordinary.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Once as I was making ready to pay some
calls, in order to frighten me, he caused the
hare’s foot on my toilet-table to leave its
carton sheath and go skipping about the
room.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“Whatever did you do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear, I was disgusted. It really
seemed as if the whole of Womanhood was
outraged. So, to <i>punish</i> him—for revenge—instead
of going to a number of houses that
day, I went to only one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There wouldn’t be time?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall always blame myself....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But a lanthorn falling in flames just then
above them put an end to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the second I’ve seen drop,” Miss
May Mant exclaimed, darting up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What have you been up to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Having my bumps examined.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By the masked professor.... Oh, the
things he said; only fancy, he told me I’d
cause the death of one both near and dear;
Ita’s near ...; but she certainly isn’t dear—odious
cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He must have thought you curiously
credulous,” Miss Sinquier murmured, turning
her head aside.</p>

<p class='c013'>To her annoyance she perceived the scholarly
representative of the <i>Dispatch</i>—a man of
prodigious size—leaning solidly on a gold-headed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>cane while appraising her to Sir
Oliver Dawtry, from her bebandeaued head to
her jewelly shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She reminds me just a little of someone
<i>de l’Évangile</i>,” she could hear the great critic
say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sylvester!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Should he speak,” Mrs. Sixsmith murmured,
wincing at the summer lightning that
flickered every now and then, “don’t forget
the mediæval nightie or the Mechlin lace!
Five long yards—a cloud....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier buried her lips in her flowers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the barred windows of the convent
opposite, certain novices appeared to be enjoying
a small saltation among themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Up and down the corridor to the yearning
melody of the minstrel players they twirled,
clinging to one another in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her fine eyes looked beautiful as, raising
them fraught with soul, they met the veteran
critic’s own.</p>

countless curtains; and in the ‘Potion
Scene,’ oh Lord, pull me through....”</p>

<p class='c013'>Unwilling to genuflect in the presence of
her maid, who would interpret any unwontedness
of gesture for first-night symptoms of
fear, Miss Sinquier lifted her face towards the
bluish light of day that filtered obliquely
through the long glass-plating above.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a cat on the skylight, Smith,”
was what she said as her maid with a telegram
recalled her wandering gaze to earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a telegram from her father.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Missed conveyance York,” she read.
“Bishopthorpe to-night archiepiscopal blessings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, well, ...” she professionally philosophized,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“there’ll be <i>deadheads</i> besides, I’ve
no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Any answer, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go, Smith, to the box office, and say G 2
and 3 (orchestra) have been returned; there’s
no answer,” she added, moving towards the
brightly lit dressing-room beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ensconced in an easy chair, before a folding
mirror that, rich in reflections, encompassed
her screen-like about, sat Mrs. Sixsmith
pensively polishing her nails.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier bit her lip.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought——” she began.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sh——! Be Juliet now. We’re in Verona,”
Mrs. Sixsmith exclaimed. “<i>Fuori</i> the doors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fancy finding <i>you.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are you doing in <i>my Italy</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith threw a glance at herself in
the glass. “I’m a girl friend,” she said; “a
Venetian acquaintance: someone <i>Julie</i> met
while paddling in the Adriatic—in fact, <i>cara
cuore</i>, I’m a daughter of the Doge. Yes; I’m
one of the Dolfin-Trons.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m Catarina Dolfin-Tron.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kitty Tron!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Your own true Kate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When are you going round?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me finish my hands. My manicurist
has left me with such claws.... Poor little
soul! When she came to my wedding-finger
she just twiddled her rasp and broke out
crying. ‘To be filing people’s nails,’ she said,
‘while my husband is filing a petition!’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wonderful that she could.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This city has its sadness. Your maid,
Smith, while you were in the other room
said, ‘Oh, marm,’ she said, ‘what you must
have endured; <i>one Smith</i> was enough for
me.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Kate!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Julie ...” Mrs. Sixsmith sighed,
when the door opening gently was followed by
the entry of Mrs. Smee.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Am I disturbing you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, come in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I want to tell you, my husband isn’t
himself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s ill?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s not himself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a hard thing for a wife to confess.
But for a première he’s nearly always in wine.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Is he ... <i>much</i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never knew him like it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith examined her nails.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So violent?” she ventured.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s more confused, dear, than violent,”
Mrs. Smee explained. “He seems to think
we’re doing <i>The Tempest;</i> Romeo’s tanned
breast he takes for Ferdinand’s. ‘Mind,
Ferdy, boy,’ I heard him say, ‘and keep the
—— out.’ Whereupon, his mind wandered
to the Russian plays I love, and he ran through
some of Irina’s lines from <i>The Three Sisters</i>:
‘My soul,’ you know she says, ‘my soul
is like an expensive piano which is locked and
the key lost.’ Ah, there’s for you; Shakespeare
never wrote that. He couldn’t. Even
by making piano, spinet. Oh, Russia!
Russia! land of Tchekhov, land of Andrief, of
Solugub, of Korelenko, of Artzibashef—Maria
Capulet salutes thee! And then my man was
moved to sing. His love, she was in Otaheite....
But as soon as he saw me he was back
at <i>The Tempest</i> again, calling me Caliban,
Countess, and I don’t know what.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, how disgraceful.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After the performance I’ll pop home—Home!—in
a drosky and shut him out.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Meanwhile?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’ll pass for a Friar. The Moujik!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’ll probably be priceless; the masses
always love the man who can make them
laugh.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier moved restlessly towards the
door and looked out.</p>

<p class='c013'>All was activity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Plants for the balcony set of a rambling,
twining nature, together with a quantity of
small wicker cages labelled “Atmospherics,”
and containing bats, owls, lizards, etc., were
in course of being prepared.</p>

<p class='c013'>The manageress knit her brows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Marquis,” she called, “instead of
teasing the animals, I suggest you complete
your toilet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“... She’d better look sharp!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Smee consulted her notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She reminds me more of a nurse-maid
than a nurse,” she murmured. “Not what <i>I</i>
should have chosen for Juliet at all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Marquis has no stage presence. And
such a poor physique—she’s too mean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway, Sally’s got fine men. I never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>saw finer fellows. Even the Apothecary!
Fancy taking the fatal dose from a lad like
that; he makes me want to live.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Smee purred.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To have interesting workmates is everything,”
she said. “Hughie Huntress, as Producer,
seemed quite stunned at the subtle
material at his disposal.... In fact, he
realized from the first, he told me, he <i>couldn’t</i>
‘produce’ all of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith lowered her voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where did Sally find her Balthasar,” she
asked, “and where did she secure her Tybalt?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear Mrs. Sixsmith, I’m not in the
management’s secrets, remember, so much as
you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Or who put her in the way of Sampson
and Gregory? And <i>where</i> did she get her
Benvolio?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Through an agent, I don’t doubt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith threw a sidelong probing
glance in the direction of the door. Already
in her heart she felt herself losing her hold. Had
the time inevitably come to make out the score?</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the open door came a squeal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sally, the owls!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave them, Réné,” Miss Sinquier ordered.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“<i>Dearest</i>, what diddlies; one has a look of
old Sir Oliver!” Miss Mant declared, coming
forward into the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Clad in a pair of striped “culottes,” she
had assumed, notwithstanding sororal remonstrance,
the conspicuous livery of Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I just looked in to thank you, darling,”
she began, “for all your sweetness and goodness....
Oh Sally, when I saw the playbill
with my name on it (right in among the
gentlemen!) I thought I should have died.
Who could have guessed ever it would be a
breeches part?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Turn round.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Such jealous murmurings already as there
are; a-citizen-of-Verona—an envious super
without a line, whispered, as I went by, that
my legs in these tissue tights had a look of
forced asparagus.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course: I knew that, Sally. But devil
take me. How I’ll hate going back into
virginals again; these trousers spoil you for
skirts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sprite.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I’d a trifling triumph too, darling,
which I chose to ignore: just as I was leaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>my dressing-room, Jack Whorwood, all dressed
up for Tybalt, accosted me with a fatuous easy
smile. ‘I want your picture, Miss Iris, with
your name on it,’ he said. ‘<i>Do</i> you?’ I said.
‘I do,’ he said. ‘Then I fear you’ll have to,’
I said. Oh, he was cross! But all the while,
Sally, he was speaking I could feel the wolf....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better be careful,” Mrs. Sixsmith snapped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As if I’d cater to his blue besoigns!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Réné, Réné?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Although I snubbed him,” Miss Iris murmured,
stooping to examine upon the toilet-table
a beribboned aeroplane filled with
sweets, “he looked <i>too</i> charming!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Smee chafed gently her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must return to my Friar,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is saying the grossest, the wickedest
things!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Smee’s sallies at times are not for
young ears,” Mrs. Smee loftily observed.
“His witticisms,” she added, “aren’t for
everyone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My friend, Miss Tird, who came to watch me
dress, was quite upset by his cochônneries!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Although your little friend appears scarcely
to be nine, she seems <i>dazed</i> by her sex and
power,” Mrs. Smee unfavourably commented.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“I’ll have to go, I suppose,” Miss Sinquier
sighed, “and see how matters stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Prenez garde: for when making up, he
mostly makes a palette of his hand,” Mrs.
Sixsmith said. “I happen to know—because
one day he caught hold of me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Smee protruded her tongue and drew
it slowly in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hist!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along the corridor the call-boy was going
his rounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>“First act beginners,” chirped he.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Sinquier quivered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“... Soften all hostile hearts and let them
love me ...” she prayed.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c012'>THE sound of rain-drops falling vigorously
upon the glass roof awoke her.
A few wind-tossed, fan-shaped leaves
tinged with hectic autumnal colours spotted
marvellously the skylight without, half-screening
the pale and monotonous sky beyond.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a yawn she sat up amid her pillows,
cushioning her chin on her knees.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the last night’s proceedings the room
was a bower of gardenia, heliotrope, and tuberose,
whose allied odours during slumber had
bewildered just a little her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flinging back the bed-clothes, she discovered
as she did so a note.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sally,” she read, “Should you be conscious
before I return, I’m only gone to market,
cordially yours, R. Iris. Such mixed verdicts!
I’ve arranged the early papers on your dressing-table.
I could find no reference to me. This
morning there were rat-marks again, and part
of a mangled bat.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Oh, those ‘atmospherics’!” Miss Sinquier
complained, finding somnolently her way into
the inner room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here all was Italy—Even the gauze-winged
aeroplane filled with sweets had an air of a
silver water-fly from some serene trans-Alpine
garden.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dropping to a fine <i>cassoni</i> she perused with
contracted brows a small sheaf of notices, the
gist of which bore faint pencilled lines below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her acting is a revelation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We found her very refreshing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There has been nothing like it for years.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to the Source.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An unfeminine Juliet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A decadent Juliet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“... The Romeo kiss—you take your
broadest fan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The kiss in Romeo takes only fifteen
minutes.... ‘Some’ kiss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Romeo kiss will be the talk of the
town.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A distinctive revival.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sat at the back of the pit-stalls and
trembled.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kiss——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The last word in kisses.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Tio, Tio, Io! Io! jug—jug!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shakespeare as a Cloak.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An immoral Juliet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before a house packed to suffocation——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Among those present at the Source last

<p class='c013'>A success: undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh God! How quite ... <i>delicious</i>!” she
murmured, snatching up a Cinquecento cope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>transformed to be a dressing-gown, and faring
forth for an airing upon the stage.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that hour there wasn’t a soul.</p>

<p class='c013'>The darkened auditorium looked wan and
eerie, the boxes caves.</p>

<p class='c013'>The churchyard scene with its unassuming
crosses, accentuating the regal sepulchre of the
Capulets (and there for that), showed grimly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wisht!” she exclaimed, as a lizard ran
over her foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Frisking along the footlights, it disappeared
down a dark trap hole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Had Réné been setting more traps? Upon
a mysterious mound by a jam-jar full of
flowers was a hunk of cheese.</p>

<p class='c013'>She stood a moment fascinated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then bracing herself, head level, hands on
hips, she executed a few athletic figures to
shake off sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly there was a cry; a cry that was

with the London streets.</p>

imperceptibly away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking out somewhat furtively
from beneath her veil, Mrs. Sixsmith could
observe only a few farmers conversing together
beneath the immemorial yews of S.
Irene.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was over.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was nothing left to do but to throw a
last glance at the wreaths.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the artists and staff of the Source
Theatre as a trifling proof of their esteem”—such
the large lyre crushing her own “Resurgam.”
And there also was the Marys’ with
their motto: “All men and women are

their entrances.” And the “Heureuse!”
tribute by the sexton’s tools—she craned—was
Yvonde <i>de</i> Yalta’s, it appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me,” he begged, “something of her
end.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed, sir——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re too weary?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I <i>hate</i> a funeral, Canon! Listening to
their Jeremiads.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You shall take my arm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her father was her cult, Canon.... In
that she resembled much the irresistible Venetian—<i>Catarina
Dolfin-Tron.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sally seldom wrote.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her time, you should remember, was
hardly her own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me something,” he insisted, “of her
broken brilliance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Only by keening her could I hope to do
that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“One would need to be a Bion. Or a
Moschus....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We laid her star-like, in the dress-circle—out
on Juliet’s bier ... Mr. and Mrs. Smee
and her dresser watched ... Berinthia ...
Sylvester ... came. I cannot loose from mind
one of the scene-shifters said to me, ‘How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>bonny she looked on the bloody balcony.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My poor darling.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the evening of her dissolution, I regret
to say there was a most unseemly fracas in the
foyer—some crazy wretch demanding back
her money, having booked her place in advance;
every one of the staff in tears and too
unstrung to heed her. Had it been a box,
Canon; or even a stall! But she only paid
four shillings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was there anything on my poor child’s
mind distressing her at all?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not that I’m aware of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No little affair...?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your girl was never loose, Canon. She
was straight. Sally was straight ... at
least,” Mrs. Sixsmith added (with a slight
shrug) ... “to the best of my knowledge,
she was!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a life of opportunity....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, sh——, sir, sh——!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Had my daughter debts?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed she had ... she owed me money.
Much money. But I won’t refer to that....
Sally owed me one thousand pounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“She owed you a thousand pounds?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She was infinitely involved.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Upon what could she spend so much?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her clothes,” Mrs. Sixsmith replied with a
nervous titter, “for one thing, were exquisite.
All from the atelier of the divine Katinka
King....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“King?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She <i>knew</i>! Puss! The white mantilla for
the Balcony scene alone cost her close on three
hundred pounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And where, may I ask, is it now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It disappeared,” Mrs. Sixsmith answered,
a quick red shooting over her face, “in the general
confusion. I hear even,” she murmured
with a little laugh, “they even filched the till!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What of the little <i>ingénue</i> she took to live
with her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“May Mant? Her sister is sending her
to school—if (that is) she can get her to go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was her inadvertence, I take it, that
caused my daughter’s death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed, sir, yes. But for her—she had
been setting traps! She and a girl called
Tird: a charming couple!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your daughter and she used frequently to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>take their meals in the boxes, which made, of
course, for mice. There was a well, you know,
below the stage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So she wrote her mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith fumbled in the depths of a
beaded pouch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There was a letter found in one of her
jacket-pockets, Canon,” she said. “Perhaps
you might care to have it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A letter? From whom?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A young coster of Covent Garden, who saw
your daughter at a stage-farewell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be so good, dear lady, as to inform me of
its contents.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s quite illiterate,” Mrs. Sixsmith murmured,
putting back her veil and glancing
humorously towards the grave.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss</span>,</p>

<p class='c017'>“I seed you at the Fisher Mat. on Friday
last and you took my heart a treat. I’m
only a young Gallery boy—wot’s in the
flower trade. But I knows wot I knows—And
you’re It. Oh Miss! I does want to see
you act in Juliet in your own butey-ful ouse,
if only you ad a seat as you could spare just
for me and a pal o’ mine as is alright. I
send you some red cars sweet and scenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>fresh from Covent Market, your true-gone</p>
<p class='c022'>“<span class='sc'>Bill</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hoping for tickets.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Poor lad. Sally would have obliged him,
I feel sure,” Canon Sinquier said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Alas, what ephemeral creatures, Canon,
we are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are in His hands.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She knew that. Sally’s faith never forsook
her.... Oh, Canon, some day perhaps I may
come to you to direct me. I’m so soul-sick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there no one in London to advise you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nobody at all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed? You astonish me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m perfectly tired of London, Canon!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your husband, no doubt, has his occupation
there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My husband and I are estranged....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve no child?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Alas, Canon! I often think ... sometimes
... I would like to adopt one. A
little country buttercup! Really ... a dog,
even the best of mannered—isn’t very <i>comme
il faut.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You seek a boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mer-cy <i>no</i>! Nothing of the sort....
You quite mistake my meaning.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Your meaning madam was obscure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I imply a girl ... a blonde! And she’d
share with me, sir, every facility, every advantage.
Her education should be my
care.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is your age?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“From thirteen——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An orphan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Preferably.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will discuss the affair presently with my
wife,” Canon Sinquier said, turning in meditation
his steps towards the wicket-gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before leaving your charming city, Canon,
I should like beyond everything to visit the
episcopal Palace: Sally used often to speak
of the art-treasures there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Art-treasures?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old pictures!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you an amateur of old pictures?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed I am. My husband once—Paul—he
paid a perfect fortune for a Dutch painting;
and will you believe me, Canon! It was only
of the back view of a horse.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A Cuyp?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A Circus—with straw-knots in its tail.
It used to hang in Mr. Sixsmith’s study;
and there it always was! Frankly,” she added,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>brushing a black kid glove to her face, “I
used sometimes to wish it would kick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re remaining here any length of
time, there are some portraits at the Deanery
that are considered to be of interest, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Portraits!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old ecclesiastical ones.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Canon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps you would come quietly to dinner.
At which of our inns are you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m at the Antelope.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know that my girl would have wished
our house to be open to you. You were her
friend. Her champion....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear Canon—don’t ... don’t: You
mustn’t! She’s at peace. Nothing can fret
her. Nothing shall fret her ... ever now.
And, you know, as a manageress, she was
liable to vast vexations.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My poor pet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’s <i>hors de combat</i>: free from a calculating
and dishonest world; ah, Canon!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We shall expect you, then, dear Sally’s
friend, to dinner this evening at eight,” Canon
Sinquier murmured as he walked away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith put up a large chiffon sunshade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and hovered staccato before the dwindling
spires and ogee dome of S. Irene.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the finest days imaginable.
The sun shone triumphantly in the midst of a
cloudless sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>She would loiter awhile among the bougainvilleas
and dark, spreading laurels of the
Cathedral green, trespassing obtusely now and
then into quiet gardens, through tall wrought-iron
gates.</p>

<p class='c013'>New visions and possibilities rare rose in her
mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>With Sally still, she could do a lot. Through
her she would be received with honours, into
the courtly circles of the Close.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those fine palatial houses, she reflected,
must be full of wealth ... old Caroline plate
and gorgeous green Limoges: Sally indeed had
proved it! The day she had opened her
heart in the Café Royal she had spoken of a
massive tureen <i>too heavy even to hold.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith’s eyes grew big.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her lost friend’s father wished for anecdotes;
anecdotes of her “broken brilliance”; he
should have them. She saw herself indulging
him with “Salliana,” wrapped in a white
lace mantilla of old Mechlin lace.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>An invitation from Canon and Mrs. Sinquier
should be adroitly played for to-night: “And
once in the house!...” she schemed,
starting as a peacock, a symbol of S. Irene,
stretched from a bougainvillea shrouded
wall its sapphire neck at her as if to peck.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her thoughts raced on.</p>

<p class='c013'>On a near hill beyond the river reach, the
sombre little church of S. Ann changed to a
thing of fancy against a yellowing sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>From all sides, seldom in unison, pealed
forth bells. In fine religious gaiety struck
S. Mary, contrasting clearly with the bumble-dumble
of S. Mark. S. Elizabeth and S.
Sebastian in Flower Street seemed in high
dispute, while across the sunset water S.
Ann-on-the-Hill did nothing but complain.
Near by S. Nicaise, half-paralysed, and impotent,
scarcely shook. Then triumphant, in
a hurricane of sound S. Irene hushed the lot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Sixsmith fetched a long, calm breath.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was already the hour he had said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And my experience tells me,” she murmured,
as she took her way towards the
Deanery, “that with opportunity and time
he may hope to succeed to Sir Oliver.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
